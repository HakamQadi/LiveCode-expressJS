What is Express.js?

Express.js is a popular and widely used web application framework for Node.js. It simplifies the process of building robust and 
scalable web applications by providing a set of features and tools that streamline the development process. 
Express.js is designed to work seamlessly with Node.js, allowing developers to create efficient and flexible server-side applications.

----------------------------------------------------

Why Use Express.js?

- Flexible :This flexibility allows developers to choose the tools and libraries they prefer for various aspects of their application.

- Routing: Express.js makes it easy to define routes for different URLs and HTTP methods. Routes determine how the server should respond to client requests. 
This modular approach simplifies the organization of your application's logic and makes it easier to manage different endpoints.

- Middleware: Middleware functions in Express.js are a powerful concept that allows you to add functionality to your application's request-response cycle.
 Middleware functions can perform tasks such as authentication, logging, data parsing, error handling, and more. They are executed sequentially.

------------------------------------------------------

* HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol): HTTP is the protocol that governs how data is exchanged between a client (usually a web browser) and a server.
 It defines a set of methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) that clients can use to request resources from the server.
  In the context of web development, HTTP is the foundation of communication between a client and a server.

* Routes: In Express.js, routes define how the server should respond to incoming requests.
 A route consists of an HTTP method (such as GET, POST, etc.) and a URL pattern (e.g., "/users"). 
 When a client makes a request to a specific URL with a specific HTTP method, the corresponding route handler is executed, generating a response to send back to the client.

* Middleware: Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request and response objects in the Express.js application's request-response cycle. 
They can perform tasks like modifying request/response objects, processing data, or terminating the request-response cycle. 
Middleware functions are executed in the order they are added to the application, allowing you to build a pipeline of processing steps. 
Express.js comes with built-in middleware, and you can also create custom middleware for specific tasks.
